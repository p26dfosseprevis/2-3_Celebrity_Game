This is a simple project designed for my AP CS class.
This code attempts to recreate the clasic game of celebrity which I learned of after I started the project
To play swap the player names from the Main file and replace them with those of you and a friend and then run the file.
Do not look at the clearly unencripted Answers to the questions. 
We are working on the honnor system here.
Have fun and please make sure to make fun of my terrible code.
